Introduction
============

    This software (named as LBBS) aims to providing a telnet-based interface for
a pure web-based BBS (named as LeafOK BBS).
    LeafOK BBS is a powerful BBS system, not only providing almost every function
that a standard BBS should have, but also giving many features other BBS hasn't
complemented yet.
    As an open source project, LeafOK BBS use MySQL as its major data depository,
and PHP as its developing language. With MySQL and PHP, LeafOK BBS becomes a
platform-independent system. It can works stably on many popular Web Servers
such as Apache and IIS.
    However, as a pure web-based BBS, its shortage is inevitable. For LeafOK BBS
uses Browser/Server as its architecture, it will cause more data traffic between
Users and Server than telnet-based BBS, and its response is a little slower than
telnet-based BBS.
    In order to conquer these shortage, a new project was launched. LBBS is a
telnet-based BBS which is full compatible with LeafOK BBS. It also uses MySQL as
its data repository, and keep coherence with the data structure of LeafOK BBS.
    LBBS is designed to be a system running on Linux, with GNU C as its developing
language. For my spare time is very limit, I decide not to make LBBS as a
cross-platform system temporarily. If you have interest in developing this system,
please contact me.
    Thank you for using this software. If you meet any bugs or have any suggestion,
please tell me.
